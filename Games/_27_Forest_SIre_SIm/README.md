# 🌲🔥 Forest Fire Simulator (Streamlit Edition)

A grid-based wildfire simulation where fire spreads across a forest based on 
adjacency rules, wind direction, and terrain behavior.

---

## 🎮 How to Play
- Each cell is one of: **Tree**, **Fire**, **Ash**, **Empty**, or **Wall**  
- Fire spreads to directly adjacent cells (↑ ↓ ← →)  
- Burning cells become **Ash** on the next step  
- Use **Ignite Fire** to start a fire anywhere  
- Use **Step Simulation** to advance one turn  
- Your goal is to **control/observe the spread** of fire

## ⭐ Additional Features (TODO List)
These are 5 innovative future upgrades:

[ ] **Auto-Simulate Mode**  
   Automatically run steps with adjustable speed.

[ ] **Random Lightning Strikes**  
   Every few steps, lightning randomly ignites a tree.

[ ] **Firefighter Units** *(implemented)*  
   A mode where user places firefighters to block fire spread.

[Done] **Wind Direction Simulation** *(implemented)*  
   Spread is stronger toward the wind’s direction.

[ ] **Tree Density Generator**  
   Slider-based map generation (sparse → dense forests).
