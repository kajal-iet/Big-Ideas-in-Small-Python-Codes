# 💎 Animated Diamonds

**Animated Diamonds** is a fun, interactive Streamlit app that lets users create and animate ASCII art diamonds. You can:

- Generate **Outline or Filled diamonds**.
- Choose the **size** of your diamond.
- Apply animations:
  - **Pulsating**: diamond grows and shrinks.
  - **Rotating**: diamond rotates 90°, 180°, and 270°.
- Control the **animation speed**.
- Start and stop animations anytime.




# TODO List

[ ] Stack shapes to form composite art, e.g., a pyramid of diamonds.
[ ] Combine shapes to make ASCII art landscapes like mountains, trees, or castles.
[ ] Triangles / Pyramids – hollow and filled.

[Done] Shapes that grow/shrink like breathing or pulsating effects.

[Done] Spinning / rotating ASCII shapes.

[ ] For instance, a diamond that slowly rotates 45° in Streamlit.
