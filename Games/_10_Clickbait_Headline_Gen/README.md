# Clickbait Headline Generator

A Python program that generates outrageous clickbait headlines automatically.  
Inspired by Al Sweigart's *Automate the Boring Stuff* projects.

---

## Overview

This program generates as many clickbait headlines as you want using **Mad Libs–style templates**.  
It randomly selects words from predefined lists (STATES, NOUNS, PLACES, WHEN, etc.) and inserts them into different headline templates.

---

## How It Works

1. You enter the number of headlines you want to generate.
2. The program randomly picks a template type and fills in words.
3. The final headline is displayed on the console.
