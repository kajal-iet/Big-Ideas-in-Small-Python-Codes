# Etching Drawer — Streamlit Edition

A digital version of the classic “Etch A Sketch” style drawing toy.
Draw using WASD keys or by clicking the interactive grid.

This edition enhances the original console program with:

✅ Undo / Redo  
✅ Save Drawing as PNG  
✅ Mouse-friendly drawing  
✅ Clean visual canvas  

---

## ✅ How It Works

- Use **W A S D** keys to move the cursor and draw.
- Or click cells directly to paint them.
- The drawing is stored as a set of pixel coordinates.
- Undo and Redo manage your draw history cleanly.
- PNG export scales up the canvas so it’s printable.
