# Ducklings Animation – Streamlit Edition

This project recreates Al Sweigart’s “Ducklings Screensaver” inside a Streamlit
web app. Each duckling is randomly generated with unique combinations of:

- Direction (left/right)
- Body type (chubby / very chubby)
- Four eye types
- Two mouth types
- Three wing positions

This produces 96 possible duckling variations that scroll across the screen.

## Features
- Smooth scrolling animation in Streamlit
- Adjustable duck density
- Adjustable animation speed
- Fully preserved randomness from the original console version

# TODO List
[ ] Night Mode — Dimmed lighting + soft candle-yellow ducklings.
[ ] Giant Duck Mode — ASCII ducks rendered at double width & height.
[Done] Duck Parade Mode — All ducks scroll in sync like a parade formation.
[ ] Seasonal Ducks — Ducks wear hats (🎅 🎃 🎓) depending on date.
